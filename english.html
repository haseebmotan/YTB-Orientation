      Hello friends, welcome to Ankara. This group is created to organize
      orientation for new students coming to Ankara within the scope of Türkiye
      Scholarships. Follow the information in the group and do not leave the
      group. Monday (25.09.2023) we will pick you up from your dormitories and
      take you to TÖMER, where we will help you with TÖMER/University
      registration and you'll also be able to visit your campus. We added most
      of the students on our list to this group, but we were unable to find a
      small number of students on WhatsApp. Therefore, we will be glad if you
      share this information with your friends living in the same dormitory.
      Shuttle service will be in front of your dormitories at 7:45 so make your
      preparations accordingly. It may be 5-10 minutes late from the scheduled
      time in the morning due to the traffic density. However, it is important
      that you wait.
    </p>
